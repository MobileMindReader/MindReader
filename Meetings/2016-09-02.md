# Introductory supervisor meeting 
## 02-09-2016

## Material to read
- Papers by Carsten Stahlhut
- Read Bishop (3.3-3.5) and maybe about expectation propagation

## Next week
- Look at existing SBS2 code - Loreta source reconstruction
- Implement Loreta-approximation (optimize SBS2 prior estimation)
- Look at spike & slab prior


## Meeting minutes

The prior is very important in approximations because the problem is ill-posed.
All this in order to map from sensor space (\\(1-10^2\\)) to source space (\\(10^3 - 10^4\\))

- \\(\bar{y} = \bar{\bar{A}} \bar{x} + \bar{\epsilon}\\)
- The prior approximation is only dependent on the ratio between \\(\alpha and \epsilon\\) (the residuals)
- \\(\alpha\\) is the hyperparameter for the prior distribution


The "new" method involves separating the contribution to a contribution variable as well as an on/off variable. This is related to the dipole model. 

- \\(y_{kt} = \Sigma_{n=1}^{N} A_{kn} x_{nt} s_{nt} + \epsilon_{kt}\\), where \\(x \in \mathbb{R}, s \in \\){0,1}
- s exhibits both spatial and temporal smoothness, adding some extra knowledge for us to use when approximating the prior -> Spike and slab prior


Quality testing the prior approximation is usually done with a "scrambled faces" data set, in order to verify if the 4 areas [ref] are active
- We probably won't be able to do that
- Quality test with eye or hand movement signals instead
