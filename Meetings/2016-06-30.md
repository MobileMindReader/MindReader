# Preliminary meeting

- New pipeline
- Artefacts (from muscles etc) -> Remove
- Classification of EEG 
    - The hard inverse problem
        - Better classification
        - Learning
- Mental state decoding
- Current use include data sampling for epilepsy patients

## Plan outline
1. What input do we get to the smartphone
2. Classification on \\(\bar{S}_t\\)
    - Brain image -> Action

First month -> Read wide in literature (not in depth)
- Research in order to delimit project
- Write introduction (somewhat)

### To read
Michael Riis Hansen 
- Spike and slab prior

Sofie T Hansen
- Learning the solution sparsity of an ill-posed linear inverse problem with the Variational Garrote
- \\(\bar{X}_t\\) = \\(\bar{\bar{A}}\\) - \\(\bar{S}_t\\) -> Leading to better classifier


Other stuff
- Inversion methods
- Current version

(j = 14, k = 1000)
